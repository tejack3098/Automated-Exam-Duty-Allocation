# Automated Exam Duty Allocation System for Teachers using Python and MySQLDB

This project involves creating a web application using Python, MySQLDB, and Tkinter, which automatically allocates exam duties to teachers while taking various constraints into consideration. The login page securely authenticates users, who are then directed to the home page. From here, users can select the teacher data file, enter non-available teacher data, and input the number of exam days. The application then randomly allocates available teachers to exam duties, and the data can be viewed and saved using the teacher data and class data buttons. The use of Python, MySQLDB, and Tkinter improves efficiency by eliminating the need for manual allocation of exam duties, saving time for teachers and administrators.
